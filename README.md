# PWC Switzerland Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience
The projects uploaded were done for PWC Switzerland in partnership with Forage. Three projects were done in all. The first project is on Diversity and Inclusion with respect to gender balance at the executive management level.
The second project is on customer retention and how manage the increasing churn rate experienced in the company. The final project is on call center trends, to gain more insights on customer and agent behaviour. The projects were visualized in Power Bi.
In summary, all the projects were carried out by first calculating important measures to help define proper Key Performance Indicators(KPI) and I went on to visualize other KPI's in the best way possible, some KPI's were showcased in Bar charts,Pie, line charts, legends...
Then on the concluding page, I wrote out my discoveries and findings and also recommended solutions to help manage the situations discovered.
